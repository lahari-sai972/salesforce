E-Commerce Automation System
Project Overview
A Salesforce-based ecommerce application built using Lightning Web Components (LWC), Apex, SOQL, and Salesforce Custom Objects.

Users can browse products, view details, add products to cart, manage quantities, and proceed to checkout.

Component Tree
ecommerceHome
productList
productCard
checkout
Component Communication
Parent → Child
productList passes product data to productCard and cart data to checkout.

Child → Parent
productCard and checkout use Custom Events to send actions and data back to productList.

Data Strategy
LDS: Used for simple Salesforce record operations where possible.
Wire: Used for reactive product retrieval through Apex.
Imperative Apex: Used for user-triggered operations such as order creation and stock updates.
Validation Strategy
Client Validation
Checkout validates required customer information before submission.

Server Validation
Apex validates important business rules such as stock availability and order data.

Reusability
productCard: Reusable for displaying different products.
checkout: Separate reusable component for customer and order information.
Debugging
One issue was that Add to Cart worked in the console but the cart did not appear on screen. We checked the event, cart data, view condition, component HTML, and deployment. Redeploying the LWC and refreshing Salesforce fixed the issue.

Architectural Decision
We separated productList, productCard, and checkout into different components instead of creating one large component. This improved reusability, maintainability, and debugging.
